Resume Ranking
Abstract
The Resume Ranking project is an AI-powered system designed to automate the resume screening process by ranking candidates based on their relevance to a given job description. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), the system extracts key details such as skills, experience, and qualifications from resumes, compares them with job requirements, and assigns a ranking score.
